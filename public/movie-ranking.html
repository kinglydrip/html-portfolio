<!-- MOVIE 1 TITLE -->
<h3>Inception</h3>

<!-- DESCRIPTION 1 -->
<p>This Christopher Nolan movie is top notch not only for the setting, but the intricate and detailed story. Our main character has to find a way to clear his name doing what he does best... Inception!</p>

<!-- MOVIE 2 TITLE -->
<h3>Madagascar</h3>

<!-- DESCRIPTION 2 -->
<p>I will watch this movie until the Earth is struck with an EMP. I know it word-for-word. The introduction of the zoo animas of New York being such a cohesive family is wonderful.</p>

<!-- MOVIE 3 TITLE -->
<h3>The Polar Express</h3>

<!-- DESCRIPTION 3 -->
<p>Gather the family for Christmas because this is the main event each Christmas.</p>
